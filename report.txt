Please concisely describe your congestion control scheme here.
No need to be verbose, brief descriptions/bullet points are preferred.

We implemented a congestion control scheme that is similar to TCP Tahoe.

We have a fixed window size, but we have a variable called `concurrent` 
that represents the number of packets that can be sent at once.

We also keep track of the number of acks for each segment in an array.

We start with concurrent = 1, is_slow_start = 1, and 
slow_start_threshold = 8.

When we start, we are in slow start mode, and we double concurrent every 
time we receive an ACK for an unACKed segment.

When we reach slow_start_threshold, we switch to congestion avoidance 
mode, and we increment concurrent by 1 every time we receive an ACK for 
an unACKed segment, this is additive increase.

On failure, we use multiplicative decrease.

If we receive 3 ACKs for a segment, we retransmit that segment and set 
concurrent and slow_start_threshold to concurrent/2.

If a timeout occurs, we retransmit the segment and set 
slow_start_threshold to concurrent/2, and then concurrent to 1, and we 
switch back to slow start mode.
